# BoarBot (Alpha v0.7.0)

This is a personal project I've set out to create for a Discord community.
I've always wanted to make something that makes people happy, so this is it.

## Commands

### /boar-manage setup
This command is used for the initial configuration of BoarBot in a Discord server. Currently only asks for a channel to handle trading, which channels commands can be used in, and if it's part of the Hypixel Skyblock community.

### /boar daily
This command is used to get your boar for the day. Some boars are rarer than others!

### Powerups
These automatically occur every 1.5 - 2.5 hours and makes getting boars more fun.
