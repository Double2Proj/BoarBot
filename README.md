# BoarBot (Alpha v0.6.0)

This is a personal project I've set out to create for a Discord community.
I've always wanted to make something that makes people happy, so this is it.

## Commands

### /boar-manage setup
This command is used for the initial configuration of BoarBot in a Discord server. Currently only asks for a channel to handle trading, which channels commands can be used in, and if it's part of the Hypixel Skyblock community.

### /boar daily
This command is used to get your boar for the day. Some boars are rarer than others!

## Plans for the future
* Powerups that spawn randomly but at the same time for all servers
* Leaderboards
* And more! (It's a secret)
